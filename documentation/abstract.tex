\begin{abstract}

We describe a distributed anonymous filesharing network based on insight from studying the efficacy and usability of anonymity services
as well as distributed filesharing and storage systems based on hash tables. Our approach to building this network is underpinned by
three equally weighted tenets: security, usability, and simplicity. First we briefly justify these principles,
then discuss our study of related work, our system architecture and performance, and some potential ideas for future improvement.
