\section{System Architecture}
\label{sec:arch}

% here are some epic diagrams of wtf we built

% again let's reiterate how we are different from the projects in our related works section

% describe user experience stuff

% bamboo underlies a nosqlesque key-value store application unrolled on each vps contribution

% updates to vps nodes are centrally controlled using github and implemented by users doing `git clone' and 'make'

% we might also do something with puppet and/or rsync if needed but likely not

% everything is implemented on planetlab for now but more nodes will be added on actual vpses once we iron out those pesky details

% now for some stats and facts about how awesome we are

% lastly we'll talk about what our next steps are
