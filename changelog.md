Changes made will go here (a rough draft of documentation)
=========================================================

end of October + November 2014
-------------

* Begin project, for reals. Rewrite what I had so far in Node, using orm to define relations on a sqlite database.

* Add two models (to be related!) the User, and the Record. A User is a unique identifier created by someone connected to
the network. It should be associated with her uploads and/or downloads, which are individually Records.
