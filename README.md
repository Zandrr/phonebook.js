**If you see something that looks dumb, insecure, or like it might have been overlooked, please change it and make a pull request. We'd be glad for the help!**

We are currently under construction! 

For a roadmap of where we're going, first check out our paper sketch, and maybe download the tarball in the documentation folder. It contains a semester project report submitted as part of my final project for ECEN 5013: Advanced Systems and Network Security, a set of slides (.odp format) used to present same, and a bibfile.

This project really has three parts: the clientside "app", the individual database node, and the networking protocols for communicating between the client and a given part of the database.

More explanation/proper documentation will be added as more progress is made.
